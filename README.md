# Delaunay-triangulation-and-Voronoi-diagram
The program implements the Delone triangluation algorithmand Voronoi diagram.  
It allows you to simultaneously show both algorithms "on top of each other"

Apart from the algorithms, you can see two sliders - they are used to reduce/
increase the alpha channel.
This way you can decrease or increase the brightness until you get it
image of only triangulation or only Voronoi diagram.  
The screenshot shows only the Voronoi diagram.
